# Allmon2-Bootstrap

Allmon2 modified to have Bootstrap 4 libraries. This is based on the great work of WD6AWP and others.

## Features
- Added Bootstrap 4 Libraries
- Removed jquery-ui and switched to Bootstrap components (modal for login)
- External links open in new tab/window by default

## TODO
- Make all libraries offline
- Enhance login mechanism
- Add extra config file/modify existing config for site-wide settings (title, color prefs, etc)
- Fully implement better astdb.php (per upstream source)

## Setup

1. Change page title on header.inc
2. Copy **allmon.ini.txt** to **allmon.ini.php**
3. Modify **allmon.ini.php** to suit your setup
4. Point your browser to wherever you have served up this folder. Usually http://*your IP*/allmon2
